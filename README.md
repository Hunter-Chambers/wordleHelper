Simple Python script to help solve Wordle

Please note that some Wordle games will may show a letter as yellow or green,
but the then show the letter as gray later on in the word. For this program to
work, you need to still list the second occurance of the letter as yellow.

For example, you guess the word 'VISIT'. Wordle marks the first 'I' as green,
but then Wordle marks the second 'I' as gray. In this program, you would list
the second 'I' as yellow.
